# /etc/inittab init(8) configuration for BusyBox
#
# Format for each entry: <id>:<runlevels>:<action>:<process>
#
# <id>: The id field is used by BusyBox init to specify the controlling tty for
#	the specified process to run on. There is no need for this field to 
#	be unique, although if it isn't you may have strange results.
#
# <runlevels>: The runlevels field is completely ignored.
#	       ( If you want runlevels, use sysvinit.)
#
# <action>: Valid actions include: sysinit, respawn, askfirst, wait, once,
#                                  restart, ctrlaltdel, and shutdown.
#
# <process>: Specifies the process to be executed and it's command line.
#
#
# Boot-time system configuration/initialization script.
# This is run first except when booting in single-user mode.
